- [ ] new flooding mpr in add_node?
- [ ] make sure NODE_TYPE_NHDP is only true for 1-hop neighbors
- [ ] dead nodes keep lingering around
- [ ] long delays even without hysteresis
- [ ] -> reintroduce pending (earlier timeout for 1-hop neighbors)
- [ ] select new flooding mpr when node is lost (B doesn't select A when B<->E is lost)
