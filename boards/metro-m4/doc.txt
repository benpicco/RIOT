### About the board

### Flash the board

Use `BOARD=metro-m4` with the `make` command.<br/>
Example with `default` application:
```
     make BOARD=metro-m4 -C examples/default flash
```

RIOT will automatically trigger a reset to the bootloader, but this only works if RIOT is still
running on the board.
If your application has crashed or got erased, `make flash` will not be able to trigger a bootloader reset.

To manually enter the bootloader, quickly press the Reset button twice.
You know you've successfully entered the bootloader when the LED begins flashing blue.

Sometimes flashing fails and the board gets stuck in the bootloader.
In this case, just run `make flash` again when the device is not busy anymore.

### Accessing STDIO via UART

STDIO of RIOT is directly available over the USB port.
